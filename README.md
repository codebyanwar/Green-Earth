1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

-->var is the old way to declare a variable. it can be accessed outside a block.

-->let is introduced in ES6. It is block scoped, so it works only inside the function. Its value can be changed.

const is also block scoped, but its value cannot be changed.



2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

map()--> works on each element of an array and returns a new array.

forEach()--> just runs a loop and does not return anything.

filter()--> returns a new array based on a condition.



3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

-->Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions in ES6.



4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

-->Destructuring allows us to easily extract values from arrays or objects. It makes the code shorter and more readable.



5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

-->Template literals use backticks ` instead of quotes. Variables can be inserted using ${}. In string concatenation, we use +, which can look messy. Template literals are cleaner, more readable, and support multiline strings.
